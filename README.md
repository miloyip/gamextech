## Schema

The database contains a set of graphs.

The [database](database.json) and graphs are stored in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format.

Each graph JSON is an object, with "nodes" and "links" array.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Please follow:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add nodes or links in related json files. Add "contributor" key optionally.
3. Testing
4. Make Pull request

If there are too many nodes/links in a single file, you may extract them into a new JSON in a suitable directory,
and add the JSON file into `/database.json`.

If you want to add a lot of data or reorganize existing structure, you may create an GitHub issue for discussion.

Adding new features and fixing bugs are welcome as well.

### i18n
If you want translate to other lang. Please follow:
1. `node addNewLang.js your-lang`
2. please translate src/your-lang 
3. Add your lang destription at i18n.json

If default lang json have new content. Please follow:
1. `node updateFromDefaultLang.js`
2. please translate src/your-lang

### Testing

Run `npm install` and `npm test` to validate the database with schema and additional checks.

Run `npm start` to start a local http server, and open one of the listed URL in the browser to view the local site.
```
Starting up http-server, serving .
Available on:
  http://192.168.1.1:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

For testing single(or several) JSON, you may use `?d=` in query string, such as `http://localhost:8000/?d=/tech/graphics/shadow.json&e=-1`.
